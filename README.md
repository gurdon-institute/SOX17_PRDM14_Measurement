# SOX17_PRDM14_Measurement
Segments nuclei in C1 and calls positive or negative for each nucleus in other channels using inclusive empirically determined thresholds.
Channel identities are parsed from image titles by taking substring matching "\w+-\d{3}", where the leading word is the gene name and the trailing digits are the fluorophore wavelength.
